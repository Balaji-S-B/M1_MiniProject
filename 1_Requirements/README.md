## Opportunities:
The LMS leaks outward into new spaces, spaces which it didn’t inhabit before, such as reading lists repositories, learning systems, research data management and so forth. Furthermore, it is likely that the future of Grade sheet systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared (or hosted) services. 

### Threats:
Examination cell, now send and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some Examination cell don’t have the right data encryption practices in place.
